# veyor-fe-front
Veyor front end coding challenge - react web app

# calls REST API veyor-fe-front
NOTE: this is a simple react app that displays a grid of images fetched from veyor-fe-front.

# Goal is to implement infinite scroll & paging
thinking about using https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized
or https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window


NOTE: used free CSS template see: `public/FRACTAL_README.txt`

## Absolute Imports
I know that absoulte imports are better for larger projects but I use vim
and I get file path completion so I like to use relative imports, especially
when the folders are not nested much.

## Storybook
Its great when developing larger projects but for this simple app its an overkill
